VII. Dictionaries

In this project, you will process some data from a group of friends playing scrabble. You will use dictionaries to organize players, words, and points.

There are many ways you can extend this project on your own if you finish and want to get more practice!


Additional functions:
play_word() — a function that would take in a player and a word, and add that word to the list of words they've played
update_point_totals() — turn your nested loops into a function that you can call any time a word is played
make your letter_to_points dictionary able to handle lowercase inputs as well
