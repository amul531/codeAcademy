II. Functions

a. Getting ready for physics class
You are a physics teacher preparing for the upcoming semester. You want to provide your students with some functions that will help them calculate some fundamental physical properties.

b. Python Functions
 1. Write a function named average() that has two parameters named num1 and num2 and returns the average of these two numbers. 

 2. Write a function named tenth_power() that has one parameter named num and returns the num raised to the 10th power.

 3. Write a function named introduction() that has two parameters named first_name and last_name and returns {last_name, first_name last_name}

 4. Write a function named square_root() that has one parameter named num and uses exponents (**) to return the square root of num.

 5. Create a function called tip() that has two parameters named total and percentage and returns the amount you should tip.

 6. Create a function called win_percentage() that takes two parameters named wins and losses and returns the total percentage of games won.

 7. Write a function named first_three_multiples() that has one parameter named num. It should print the first three multiples of num and return the third multiple.

 8. Write a function named dog_years() that has two parameters named name and age. The function should compute the age in dog years and return the following string:"{name}, you are {age} years old in dog years".
 Every one year of a human's life is equivalent to seven years of a dog's life. 

 9. Write a function named remainder() that has two parameters named num1 and num2 and returns the remainder of twice num1 divided by half of 
 num2.
 
 10. Create a function named lots_of_math(). This function should have four parameters named a, b, c, and d. The function should print 3 lines and return 1 value.
 First, the sum of a and b.
 Second, d subtracted from c.
 Third, the first number printed, multiplied by the second number printed.
 Finally, it should return the third number printed mod a.
